# EXP 16: Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

##  Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

##  Program

```
import math
class cse:
    def mech(self,radius):
        Area=math.pi*radius**2
        print(f"Area of circle: {Area:.2f}")
        
radius=float(input())
object=cse()
object.mech(radius)
```

## Result
Thus, the program is verified successfully
